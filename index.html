		<p>1. My name is Lucy Hagenbuch, I am a junior studying Illustration and Political Science! 
		</p>
		<p>2. I am a ComDes student so it is a pretty neccessary skill, especially because I know exactly nothing about how they make those websites look good
		</p>
		<p>3. I do not have experience with anything outside of RStudio, and that is only relevant for my Polisci classes because I study QPM!
		</p>
		<p> 4. I know this is redundant but I want to be able to make an portfolio for myself that doesn't look too mad ugly.
		</p>
		<p> 5. With the drastic layout changes between different portable devices as well as the massive leap between portable electronics and desktop views, I think that the fluid element of web design is very different from the book as a physical object.
		</p>
		<p>6. A link to a website that exemplifies effective design. 
			<a href="http://www.emcarroll.com/" title="Emily Carroll Website" target="_blank">I think this</a> is an interesting look at how an artist can treat their generated graphics minimally in order to achieve dynamic design while still engaging with the medium in a traditional way.
		</p>
		<p>7. While
			<a href="https://www.christianrexvanminnen.com/" title="Van Minnen artist portfolio" target="_blank"> this website </a> has a very formulaic approach in terms of digital portfolios, I think that its design is very readable and effective.
		</p>
		<p>8. Here’s a website that I think works really well. 
			<a href="https://crumbskees.com/" title="It’s The CrumbsKeEs" target="_blank">This website</a> is a really engaging way to create a design where the interactive web elements amplify the visual components as well as the practical functions of the website.
